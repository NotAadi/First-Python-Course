    "0. (special rules) - Face cards have a value of 10, aces can be either 1 or 11, depending on what the player wants\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The player object has a bankroll which they can use to place a bet if they think they will win this set of hands.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The player starts with 2 cards face up, and the dealer starts with one card face up and another card face down. The player goes first in gameplay.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The player's goal is to get closer to a total value of 21 than the dealer does (the total value would be the sum of the face-up cards). The player has 2 possible actions - to __hit__ (recieve another card from the deck) or to __stay__ (stop recieving cards). If the player keeps hitting and goes over 21, they __bust__ (to bust is to have a sum greater than 21). If the dealer beats the player, they will collect the money) and lose the bet. The game is over and the dealer collects the money.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. After the player goes, it is the computer's turn. If the player is under 21, the dealer then hits until they either beat the player (have a higher total sum) or bust . If the dealer busts, the human player wins and 2x their bet goes into their bankroll."
