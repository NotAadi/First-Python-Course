    "Before you go into this, you need to understand that modules are just .py scripts that you call in another .py script, and packages are just collections of modules. Remember that jupyter does not create .py but instead .ipynb files, so we will need to use sublime text for this: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What we are going to do is first create a new file, save it as .py, and then create another file saved as .py which runs that module, and save it at the same location as the other file. In the module, we will create a very simple function. THen, you will do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "from module1 import mod1\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Then, inside of the subfolder, create another __init__.py file, and this will be blank as well. Then, close them both after saving. you wont need them anymore. THen,  create another file inside of teh package folder but not inside the subfolder, and name it some_main_script.py. Save that, then create a new file  inside the subpackage. call it mysubscript.py. Then inside of the file named mysubscript.py, create a simple function. Then, in the some_main_script folder, create another simple program.\n",
